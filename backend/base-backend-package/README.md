# Base Backend Package

This package provides the base setup to build a new backend package at Buffer:
- ESlint + Prettier
- TypeScript
- Jest
- Package commands

## How to use

For now, simply copy-paste this folder, then manually edit the package.json:
- name
- version
- description
- homepage
- keywords

In the future, we should write a `npx` script instead of having to copy-paste.
